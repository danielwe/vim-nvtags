# vim-nvtags: Create dynamic tag-based indexes in vim

This plugin lets you create and update lists of links to #tagged files. It provides the command `:NVTags <query>`, which recursively searches the current directory for files with tags that match `<query>`, and inserts a list of links to the matching files. The command `:NVTagsHere` extracts the query from the current line.

These commands can for example be used to maintain a dynamic index to a collection of notes.

## Dependencies

[`vim-percent`](https://github.com/danielwe/vim-percent) must be installed and loaded before `vim-nvtags`. Handles percent-encoding of file paths in markdown links.

## Tagging

By default, tags are defined by the pattern `'#\w{2,}(/|\w)*'`, i.e., `#` followed by at least two word characters, and then any sequence of forward slashes and more word characters. A custom pattern can be configured using the `g:nvtags_pattern` variable; for example, if you want tags to be `@`-prefixed, capitalized, ASCII-only words with two or more letters, try `let g:nvtags_pattern = '@[[:upper:]][[:alpha:]]+'`.

Since `ripgrep` is used for searching, the [Rust regex syntax](https://docs.rs/regex) applies.

A file's _tag line_ is the first line that contains a sequence of white space-delimited tags, and an optional, arbitrary prefix separated from the tags by a colon `:`. If you want to enforce a particular prefix, set the variable `g:nvtags_tagline_prefix` to a matching pattern; for example, use `let g:nvtags_tagline_prefix = '[Tt]ags'` to only allow tag lines of the form `tags: #tag1 #tag2 [...]`, with optional capitalization. Any amount of white space is allowed around the prefix, the `:` separator, and the tags.

Typically, a tag line is added at or near the top of a file, like so:

```markdown
# Heading 1

  #all #the #tags

Lorem ipsum...
```

Or, with a prefix, (required if `let g:nvtags_tagline_prefix` is set):

```markdown
# Heading 1

Tag list: #all #the #tags

Lorem ipsum...
```

The full pattern used for matching tag lines is available in `g:nvtags_tagline_pattern`.

## Querying

The `:NVTags` command matches tag lines to a query using [`fzf`'s `--exact` mode](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#search-syntax "Search syntax"), and appends a list of links to the matching files below the cursor line in the current buffer. This not a fuzzy search, but individual search terms can be composed flexibly and in any order. Examples:

* `:NVTags #tag1`: matches all files tagged with `#tag1`.
* `:NVTags #tag1 #tag2`: matches all files tagged with `#tag1` _and_ `#tag2`.
* `:NVTags #tag1 | #tag2`: matches all files tagged with `#tag1` _or_ `#tag2`.
* `:NVTags #tag1 !#tag2`: matches all files tagged with `#tag1` but _not_ `#tag2`.

Note that the search terms match on substrings: `:NVTags #tag1` will also match files tagged with `#tag12`, `#tag123`, and so on, and `:NVTags !#tag2` will only match files not tagged with any of `#tag23`, `#tag234`, and so on. This can be used to flexibly support hierarchical tagging: `#tag1` matches both `#tag1/subtag1` and `#tag1/subtag2`.

The query can optionally begin with a number to limit the number of search results. For example, `:NVTags 5 #tag1` will return up to 5 files tagged with `#tag1`. These will be the first 5 lines returned from the search; see [Search result handling](#search-result-handling) for sort order.

The command `:NVTagsHere`, uses the contents of the current line as the search query, discarding any prefix up to and including the last colon `:` on the line.

The commands can be called with an optional line number, e.g., `:5NVTags <query>` or `.-1NVTagsHere`. The line number detemines where the link list is appended, but not which line the query is extracted from: `:NVTagsHere` always takes its query from the current cursor line.

The command `:NVTagsAll` runs `:NVTagsHere` on all query lines in the buffer. If `g:nvtags_tagline_prefix` remains unset, a query line is essentially the same as a tag line, but also allows fzf modifiers around the tag search terms, i.e., one of `',^,!,!^` at the start and/or `$` at the end. If `g:nvtags_tagline_prefix` is nonempty, a query line is any such line _except_ a valid tag line.

Note that `:NVTagsAll` relies on a very rudimentary and experimental translation of regexes from rust syntax to vim syntax.<sup id="fnref1">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> The pattern used to match query lines can be inspected in `g:nvtags_queryline_pattern`.

### Interoperability with `notational-vim-fzf`

If [`notational-fzf-vim`](https://github.com/alok/notational-fzf-vim) is installed, this plugin defines four additional commands:

* For interactive tag searches:
  * `:NT[!] <query>`:
  Starts an interactive fzf search over tag lines; like running `:execute 'NV[!]' g:nvtags_tagline_pattern`. The fzf query field will be prefilled with any arguments passed to `:NT` (this only works without the `!`).

  * `:NTHere`:
  Like `:NT`, but extracts the prefilled fzf query from the current line, like `:NVTagsHere`.
* For finding files that link to or mention the current file:
  * `NVBacklinks[!]`:
  Starts an interactive fzf search over lines that contain a markdown link to the current file. More precisely, matching lines are lines with a link to a file of the same name regardless of path/directory, so false positives can occur if the name of the current file is not unique or there exist links to nonexistent files (ensuring that the links actually point to the current file isn't worth the logical complexity).

  * `NVMentions[!]`:
  Starts an interactive fzf search over lines that contain the title of the current file. The title is taken to be the content of the first H1 ATX heading in the file, i.e., the first line starting with `# `.

## Search result handling

For now, `:NVTags[Here]` inserts a list of markdown links to the matching files, grabbing the link text from the first line in the file and [percent-encoding](#percent-encodingdecoding) the address to obtain a valid URL. The links are sorted in inverse order of last modification time, such that the last modified matching file is listed first. This is not customizable; perhaps the future will bring about more flexibility?

The command `:NVTagsClear` deletes a previously appended list of links below the given line.

The banged commands `:NVTags!`, `NVTagsHere!`, and `:NVTagsAll!` _replace_ any previously inserted list of links instead of merely appending.

## Filename filtering

By default, the `:NVTags*` commands search all files that are not hidden or excluded by `.gitignore` and similar files. Custom filename filtering can be configured by setting `g:nvtags_globs` to a list of glob patterns to include/exclude. Examples:

* `let g:nvtags_globs = ['*.md', '*.mkd', '*.markdown']`: Only include markdown files.
* `let g:nvtags_globs = ['!*.html']`: Exclude HTML files.

## Usage tips

You can create a dynamic index page for a note collection by doing something like this in a file at the root directory of the collection:

```markdown
[...]

**Journal**: #journal
  
* [2019-08-28 New plugin out!](New%20plugin%20out%21%2020190828124102.md "#journal #vim")
* [...]

**Current physics reading notes**: #article #physics !#archived
  
* [Space-Time Approach to Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics [@Feynman1948]](%40Feynman1948%2020181224170000.md "#article #physics/quantum #Feynman")
* [...]

**The two latest work meetings and talks**: 2 #work #meeting | #talk
  
* [Meeting with project A stakeholders](Meeting%20with%20project%20A%20stakeholders%2020190715110311.md "#meeting #work/projectA")
* [Department HSE briefing](Department%20HSE%20briefing%2020190712143148.md "#talk #work")

[...]
```

Update each list by placing the cursor on the query line and running `:NVTagsHere!`. Update all of them at once by running `:NVTagsAll!`.

Someday, maybe.
